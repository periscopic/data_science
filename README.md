Periscopic Data Science
====

We reuse a lot of the same code day-to-day here for data munging: reading files into pandas, taking a quick look, dropping NAs, joins, output, and so on. We'd like to share this in a simple modular format (using [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), of course) to make our lives easier and to contribute to other people's workflows, if possible!

We're starting out slowly here, but as we have a more complete repertoire here we'll be more vocal about this. Thanks! If you have questions, feel free to reach out to Melissa by email at her first name + Periscopic's URL.
